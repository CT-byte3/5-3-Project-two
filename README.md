# 5-3-Project-two
CS 210 Programming Languages. Project two develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time.

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project aimed to create a C++ program for Airgead Banking that calculates and displays investment growth. Users can input their initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years they want to calculate. The program displays a tabular summary of the investment growth, including a "Total" column showing the sum of the opening amount and deposited amount for each month. This project helps users understand how their investments will grow over time and make informed financial decisions.

- What did you do particularly well?
The code is well-structured, object-oriented, and adheres to best practices. It provides a clear and user-friendly interface, ensuring that user inputs are validated. It uses precision and formatting to display monetary values accurately, and the pseudocode effectively outlines the logic of the code.

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One improvement could be the addition of exception handling to handle unexpected errors. Additionally, providing the option to save the investment summary to a file for future reference could enhance usability. This improvement can be especially beneficial when dealing with long-term investments. Furthermore, code comments could be added for better code documentation and 

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of the code might have been correctly calculating and displaying the investment summary while accounting for monthly deposits. Overcoming this challenge involved careful design of the loop that iterates through each month and ensures that the "Total" reflects the sum of the opening amount and deposited amount.

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project provides skills in object-oriented programming, input validation, precision handling, and tabular data presentation. These skills are highly transferable to other projects involving financial calculations, data manipulation, and user interfaces.

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make the program maintainable and readable, the code follows standard C++ conventions, uses meaningful variable and function names, and employs comments to explain important sections. The use of object-oriented principles and a clear class structure makes it adaptable for potential future modifications or extensions.
